It's probably not easy to make such a worthless film... 
This is one baaaaaaaaad movie. 
The gorgeously elaborate continuation of `` The Lord of the Rings '' trilogy is so huge that a column of words can not adequately describe co-writer/director Peter Jackson 's expanded vision of J.R.R. Tolkien 's Middle-earth .
when Leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie .
At least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch .
Like its title character , Esther Kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating .
Staggeringly dreadful romance .  
An incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people ... manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy .
The film just might turn on many people to opera , in general , an art form at once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and as emotionally grand as life .
As vulgar as it is banal .
Just dreadful .
( A ) crushing disappointment .
It 's not life-affirming -- its vulgar and mean , but I liked it .
The draw ( for `` Big Bad Love '' ) is a solid performance by Arliss Howard .
There are far worse messages to teach a young audience , which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy .
The main story ... is compelling enough , but it 's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish .
A painfully funny ode to bad behavior .   
... spellbinding fun and deliciously exploitative .    
Ah , what the hell . 
This one is not nearly as dreadful as expected .
