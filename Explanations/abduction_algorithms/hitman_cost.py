        Hitman

    ==================
    Module description
    ==================

    A SAT-based implementation of an implicit minimal hitting set [1]_
    enumerator. The implementation is capable of computing/enumerating
    cardinality- and subset-minimal hitting sets of a given set of sets.
    Cardinality-minimal hitting set enumeration can be seen as ordered (sorted
    by size) subset-minimal hitting enumeration.

    The minimal hitting set problem is trivially formulated as a MaxSAT formula
    in WCNF, as follows. Assume :math:`E=\{e_1,\ldots,e_n\}` to be a universe
    of elements. Also assume there are :math:`k` sets to hit:
    :math:`s_i=\{e_{i,1},\ldots,e_{i,j_i}\}` s.t. :math:`e_{i,l}\in E`. Every
    set :math:`s_i=\{e_{i,1},\ldots,e_{i,j_i}\}` is translated into a hard
    clause :math:`(e_{i,1} \\vee \ldots \\vee e_{i,j_i})`. This results in the
    set of hard clauses having size :math:`k`. The set of soft clauses
    comprises unit clauses of the form :math:`(\\neg{e_{j}})` s.t.
    :math:`e_{j}\in E`, each having weight 1.

    Taking into account this problem formulation as MaxSAT, ordered hitting
    enumeration is done with the use of the state-of-the-art MaxSAT solver
    called :class:`.RC2` [2]_ [3]_ [4]_ while unordered hitting set enumeration
    is done through the *minimal correction subset* (MCS) enumeration, e.g.
    using the :class:`.LBX`- [5]_ or :class:`.MCSls`-like [6]_ MCS enumerators.

    :class:`Hitman` supports hitting set enumeration in the *implicit* manner,
    i.e. when sets to hit can be added on the fly as well as hitting sets can
    be blocked on demand.

    An example usage of :class:`Hitman` through the Python ``import`` interface
    is shown below. Here we target unordered subset-minimal hitting set
    enumeration.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> from pysat.examples.hitman import Hitman
        >>>
        >>> h = Hitman(solver='m22', htype='lbx')
        >>> # adding sets to hit
        >>> h.hit([1, 2, 3])
        >>> h.hit([1, 4])
        >>> h.hit([5, 6, 7])
        >>>
        >>> h.get()
        [1, 5]
        >>>
        >>> h.block([1, 5])
        >>>
        >>> h.get()
        [2, 4, 5]
        >>>
        >>> h.delete()

    Enumerating cardinality-minimal hitting sets can be done as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> from pysat.examples.hitman import Hitman
        >>>
        >>> sets = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 4], [5, 6, 7]]
        >>> with Hitman(bootstrap_with=sets, htype='sorted') as hitman:
        ...     for hs in hitman.enumerate():
        ...         print(hs)
        ...
        [1, 5]
        [1, 6]
        [1, 7]
        [3, 4, 7]
        [2, 4, 7]
        [3, 4, 6]
        [3, 4, 5]
        [2, 4, 6]
        [2, 4, 5]

    Finally, implicit hitting set enumeration can be used in practical problem
    solving. As an example, let us show the basic flow of a MaxHS-like [7]_
    algorithm for MaxSAT:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> from pysat.examples.hitman import Hitman
        >>> from pysat.solvers import Solver
        >>>
        >>> hitman = Hitman(htype='sorted')
        >>> oracle = Solver()
        >>>
        >>> # here we assume that the SAT oracle
        >>> # is initialized with a MaxSAT formula,
        >>> # whose soft clauses are extended with
        >>> # selector literals stored in "sels"
        >>> while True:
        ...     hs = hitman.get()  # hitting the set of unsatisfiable cores
        ...     ts = set(sels).difference(set(hs))  # soft clauses to try
        ...
        ...     if oracle.solve(assumptions=ts):
        ...         print('s OPTIMUM FOUND')
        ...         print('o', len(hs))
        ...         break
        ...     else:
        ...         core = oracle.get_core()
        ...         hitman.hit(core)

    """
        A cardinality-/subset-minimal hitting set enumerator. The enumerator
        can be set up to use either a MaxSAT solver :class:`.RC2` or an MCS
        enumerator (either :class:`.LBX` or :class:`.MCSls`). In the former
        case, the hitting sets enumerated are ordered by size (smallest size
        hitting sets are computed first), i.e. *sorted*. In the latter case,
        subset-minimal hitting are enumerated in an arbitrary order, i.e.
        *unsorted*.

        This is handled with the use of parameter ``htype``, which is set to be
        ``'sorted'`` by default. The MaxSAT-based enumerator can be chosen by
        setting ``htype`` to one of the following values: ``'maxsat'``,
        ``'mxsat'``, or ``'rc2'``. Alternatively, by setting it to ``'mcs'`` or
        ``'lbx'``, a user can enforce using the :class:`.LBX` MCS enumerator.
        If ``htype`` is set to ``'mcsls'``, the :class:`.MCSls` enumerator is
        used.

        In either case, an underlying problem solver can use a SAT oracle
        specified as an input parameter ``solver``. The default SAT solver is
        Glucose3 (specified as ``g3``, see :class:`.SolverNames` for details).

        Objects of class :class:`Hitman` can be bootstrapped with an iterable
        of iterables, e.g. a list of lists. This is handled using the
        ``bootstrap_with`` parameter. Each set to hit can comprise elements of
        any type, e.g. integers, strings or objects of any Python class, as
        well as their combinations. The bootstrapping phase is done in
        :func:`init`.
